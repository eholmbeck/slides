    <!-- Make Th and Eu a different color -->
    <aside class="notes">
    For stars that show the entire r-process pattern, there is a variation from star to star in the actinide-to-lanthanide ratio.
    For example, in Reticiulum II, the "r-process dwarf galaxy," the one star where a thorium abundance could be measured shows a low actinide-to-lanthanide abundance.
    On the other hand, some are enhanced in thorium, these actinide-boost stars.
    Most r-proces enhanced stars have a relative thorium abundance that approximately agrees with the Solar value.
    We call these "normal" because if you use cosmochronometry to estimate an age for these stars using radioactive Th, you get an age that's around what you'd expect, about 11 Gyr.
    The actinide-poor and actinide-rich stars will either give you an age that's older than the Universe, or a negative age.
    Since the actinides are only made by the r-proces, these differences in the relative actinide abundances clue us into certain r-process conditions, or point to different r-proces sites entirely, that are responsible for producing the actinides.

    <!-- Just show the movie and "notice that as the material gets more and more n-rich, the actinides oscillate.. We can see this explicitly next.." -->
    <aside class="notes">
    In an astrophysical r-process event, the initial electron fraction---or Ye---is one parameter that sensitively affects the final r-process abundances that are produced.
    Just as a reminder, a lower Ye means more neutron-rich, and higher Ye is more proton-rich
    and essentially sets the initial amount of neutrons that are available to participate in neutron-capture.
    [MOVIE] For example, with all else being equal, in certain situations, starting at a somewhat low Ye may produce just the second r-process peak---elements like Barium and Tellurium.
    Decreasing the initial Ye produces the lanthanides, but not necessarily the third peak.
    Further decreasing the initial Ye can eventually produce actinides in the final abundance pattern.
    Then, as the initial material gets more and more neutron-rich, the actinides oscillate. We see this explicitly in [NEXT]

    This combination of Ye was based off of literature estimates for NSM ejecta.
    Each of these blue and green lines is the final abundance pattern from choosing a single initial Ye.
    The red is after combining all of those patterns using some weighting motivated by literature.

	So we built a model to do this that uses a Monte Carlo method.
	First, we ran about one hundred r-process nucleosynthesis simulations using PRISM 
	starting at different Ye's, each of which produces a distinct final abundance pattern.
	Then, we give the model constraints using three elements.
	[PLAY]
	The model randomly picks a number of initial Ye's, then adds together the final abundance patterns.
	If the summed abundance pattern agrees with the input abundances, then we keep that randomly-chosen set of Ye's and add them to this distribution on the left.
	This is the orange line in this movie. We run this hundred of thousands of times until this distribution converges.
	In the end, this distribution shows how the ejecta of an r-process event could have been distributed in Ye
	in order to produce the input stellar abundances on the right.

	  The mass distribution for an actinide-poor case leads to less material in this very neutron-rich region,

      We can quantify the contribution from the very-low Ye component. 
      This plot is a little complicated. Basically, we ran a series of these simulations where we varied the required actinide contribution systematically, 
      and this axis shows what percentage of the total ejected mass is allowed to be in that low-Ye tail.
      The gray dots show what the low-Ye contribution would be for individual stars after running this model.
      Notice a few things. First, the low-Ye contribution that we get from the ADM results varies smoothly from actinide-poor to actinide-boost. 
      Secondly, the actinide-boost stars are just at the tail of an otherwise normal/Gaussian distribution.
      To explain the majority of the range of actinide abundances, the low-Ye ejecta need only be between 10 and 30% of the total ejected mass,
      which isn't too significance of a difference.
      So what does this imply?

	  In addition to gravitational waves, GW170817 released electromagnetic radiation.
	  To explain the lightcurve from this event, many studies have argued that there must have been at least two components of the NSM ejecta:
	  a lanthanide-poor blue component, and a lanthanide-rich red component.
	  So we can do the same thing with our distribution to test if it matches with this observation.

	  Inspired by this red and blue component model, we split our mass distributions into red and blue components, 
	  and calculated the lanthanide mass fractions and the mass ratio between them. 
	  And we get some numbers. 
	  Now compare that to the same numbers from an independent study of GW170817.
	  We see rough consistency, which is interesting considering we built these distribution from spectroscopic observations of r-process enhanced stars,
	  and the numbers from the kilonova are from an entirely different kind of observation.
	  This is what we come up with just from stellar abundances---three elemental abundances in particular.
	  It's still possible that our results from the r-process enhanced stars could be from a different r-process site, 
	  but these results are surprisingly similar considering our vastly different approaches.

	  What we derived from observations of stars is similar to results derived from a NSM observation.
	  This could suggest that the r-process enhanced stars like Ret II were indeed enriched by a NSM event.
	  It does not need to be a NSM merger. For example, a collapsar could yield similar results.
