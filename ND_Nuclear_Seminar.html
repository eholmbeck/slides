    <aside class="notes">
    Here on Earth and in the Solar System, we find a full range of elements from the light elements created in the Big Bang to the actinides, Th and U.
    We think we have a very good idea how most of the elements through iron were made: many by stars through fusion explosive events.
    To create most of the heavy elements requires neutron-capture processes. 
    Specificially, the slow neutron capture process (or s-process), where the timescale to capture neutrons is slower than beta decay; and rapid neutron capture (or r-process), where successive neutron captures occur before the nucleus beta-decays.

    <aside class="notes">
      Many of you know this, but just as a reminder,
      for n-capture, a nucleus will move towards the right on this chart.
      Eventually, it will become unstable and undergo beta-decay, where the neutron turns into a proton.
      When beta-decay happens, the nucleus moves to a higher charge number.
      The slow neutron capture process (or s-process), where the timescale to capture neutrons is slower than beta decay; and rapid neutron capture (or r-process), where successive neutron captures occur before the nucleus beta-decays.
      The net effect of the neutron capture timescale for the s- and r-processes is that the s-process takes place very close to stability, and the r-process very far from stability, and the nuclei tend to pile up at the closed neutron shells.
      The slow neutron-capture process, or s-process, likely occurs in asymptotic giant branch stars during their normal evolution.
      On the other hand, the rapid neutron-capture, or r-process, requires high neutron number densities, which cannot be attained during quiescent stellar burning, and indicates an explosive environment.

    <aside class="notes">
      In an r-process, the system stars with some seed distribution of nuclei. Then, in neutron-rich conditions,
      these nuclei capture neutrons and become heavier elements through a combination of beta-decays
      and photodissociations. At the very top of the chart of nuclides, the material may fission.
      It's not that our network stops here; these nuclei we predict to fission, then the fragments
      that that nucleus breaks into can themselves participate in the r-process.
      When the neutron flux falls off, the network drops out of (n,g)-(g,n) equilibrium,
      and this time is known as freezeout. After freezeout, the nuclei *pretty much* decay back
      towards the Valley of Nuclear Stability in a series of beta-decays, alpha-decays, or fission.

      In the Solar System, the isotopic abundances can be split into how much came from an
      r-process. Just as a reminder, when we talk about the peaks, they refer to the abundance peaks
      at A~80, ~130, and ~190. The "lanthanides" might be interchangeably referred to as "rare earth"
      elements, and my favorite are the actinides---Th and U, the heaviest observable elements---
      which are in that row below the lanthanides on the periodic table.

     R-II stars are perfect for this since they are essentially records of nearly pure r-process events.
     The r-II stars have an elemental pattern that nearly duplicates what we observe in the Solar System.
     And on top of that, compared to their iron content, these stars have more than 10 times as much r-process material as the Solar System.
      The abundance patterns of r-process enhanced stars like this looks exactly like what we expect an r-process pattern to look like in our Solar System.

      As you probably know by now, The R-Process Alliance was established a couple of years ago, 
      with one main goal to identify more of these r-II stars. A soft goal is to quadruple the
      number of known r-II stars from about 25 to 100.
      Through this huge undertaking, the R-Process Alliance has already observed over 1700 metal-poor stars.
      Over 500 of those are either published or ready to be published.
      We expect about 3 to 5 percent of metal-poor stars to be r-II stars, 
      so it's necessary to observe such a large number of metal-poor stars to get to our goal of 75.
      Of those 500, we have already identified over 30 new r-II stars.

      How we identify these r-II stars is through high-resolution spectroscopy.
      The r-process signatures we look for do not appear with lower-resolution spectra, so we need to take high-resolution.
      It takes about 30 minutes on a 2.5-meter telescope to obtain each of these spectra.
      We look for mainly three elements to characterize the stars we observe: Strontium, Barium, and Europium.
      Then we use the relative abundances of these elements to classify whether the stars are r-process enhanced.
      In particular, we use Europium to classify r-II stars since Europium is mainly produced by the r-process.
      Notice this r-II star has a very strong Europium feature, but these other two stars are not as enhanced in r-process elements.
      We do this for each star in our sample in order to produce plots like these [NEXT SLIDE].

      To investigate this, we use PRISM: an r-process network solver written 
      by Trevor Sprouse and Matt Mumpower. Prism allows for complete flexibility 
      of the nuclear and astrophysical input. Each full r-process calculation 
      takes on the order of minutes, which means we can perform many calculations very quickly.
      For the actinide boost problem, we choose a low-entropy, NSM tidal 
      ejecta trajectory and vary the initial electron fraction. From here on out,
      I'll be talking about this Y_e, the electron fraction. Y_e essentially
      measures the fraction of nucleons that are protons. So just remember
      that a lower Y_e means more neutrons, and a higher Y_e is more protons.
      We ran 50 separate, full r-process calculations, changing the initial 
      Y_e between 0 and 0.25. We run each of these to 1 Gyr, so every abundance 
      pattern I'll be showing are the final abundances at 1 Gyr.

    <aside class="notes">
    To investigate this, we studied the affect of initial electron fraction on the final r-process abundances.
    In an astrophysical r-process event, the initial electron fraction---or Ye---is one parameter that sensitively affects the final r-process abundances that are produced.
    For those a but rusty on this notation, a lower Ye means more neutron-rich, and higher Ye is more proton-rich
    and essentially sets the initial amount of neutrons that are available to participate in neutron-capture.
    [MOVIE] With all else being equal, in certain situations, starting at a somewhat low Ye may produce just the second r-process peak---elements like Barium and Tellurium.
    Decreasing the initial Ye produces the lanthanides, but not necessarily the third peak.
    Further decreasing the initial Ye can eventually produce actinides in the final abundance pattern.
    Then, as the initial material gets more and more neutron-rich, the actinides oscillate. We see this explicitly in [NEXT]

      We can quantify the contribution from the very-low Ye component. 
      This plot is a little complicated. Basically, we ran a series of these simulations where we varied the required actinide contribution systematically, 
      and this axis shows what percentage of the total ejected mass is allowed to be in that low-Ye tail.
      The gray dots show what the low-Ye contribution would be for individual stars after running this model.
      Notice a few things. First, the low-Ye contribution that we get from the ADM results varies smoothly from actinide-poor to actinide-boost. 
      Secondly, the actinide-boost stars are just at the tail of an otherwise normal/Gaussian distribution.
      To explain the majority of the range of actinide abundances, the low-Ye ejecta need only be between 10 and 30% of the total ejected mass,
      which isn't too significance of a difference.

	  there is pretty good agreement of theory with theory.

	<aside class="notes">
	  This could mean that stars showing the extra enhancement of actinides could be made by the same r-process site as the actinide-deficient case.
	  For example, this is accommodated in a NSM model by different amounts of dynamical ejecta where very robust actinide production may occur.
	  [NEXT] Well, we have observations of one NSM event, so we can compare our distribution to observations to test if they agree with a NSM.

	  In addition to gravitational waves, GW170817 released electromagnetic radiation.
	  To explain the lightcurve from this event, many studies have argued that there must have been at least two components of the NSM ejecta:
	  a lanthanide-poor blue component, and a lanthanide-rich red component.
	  So we can do the same thing with our distribution to test if it matches with this observation.

	  Inspired by this red and blue component model, we split our mass distributions into red and blue components, 
	  and calculated the lanthanide mass fractions and the mass ratio between them. 
	  And we get numbers. 
	  We compare that to the same numbers from an independent study of GW170817.
	  It's amazing that they are so similar considering we built these distribution from spectroscopic observations of r-process enhanced stars,
	  and the numbers from the kilonova are from an entirely different kind of observation.
	  This is what we come up with just from stellar abundances---three elemental abundances in particular.
	  It's still possible that our results from the r-process enhanced stars could be from a different r-process site, 
	  but these results are surprisingly similar considering our vastly different approaches.

	<aside class="notes">
	  What we derived from observations of stars is similar to results derived from a NSM observation.
	  This could suggest that the r-process enhanced stars like Ret II were indeed enriched by a NSM event.
	  It does not need to be a NSM merger. For example, a collapsar could yield similar results.
