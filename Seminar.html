    Here on Earth and in the Solar System, we find a full range of elements from the light elements created in the Big Bang to the actinides, Th and U.
    We think we have a very good idea how most of the elements through iron were made: many by stars through fusion explosive events.
    To create most of the heavy elements requires neutron-capture processes. 
    Specificially, the slow neutron capture process (or s-process), where the timescale to capture neutrons is slower than beta decay; and rapid neutron capture (or r-process), where successive neutron captures occur before the nucleus beta-decays.

    <aside class="notes">
      Before we dive into the details about neutron-capture, I would be remiss if I did not mention the chart of nuclides.
      This is basically an expanded periodic table with element (or charge number) on the y-axis and neutron number on the x-axis, indicating the isotope.
      Hydrogen is in this corner, and Th and U are up here.
      The lower right are neutron-rich, and the upper left are proton rich.
      Stability....decay...
      So let's zoom in on this chart and talk about neutron-capture.

    <img src="./img/ncap_paths.png" alt="processes" style="width: 100%" align="center"/>
    <aside class="notes">
      For n-capture, a nucleus will move towards the right on this chart.
      Eventually, it will become unstable and undergo beta-decay, where the neutron turns into a proton.
      When beta-decay happens, the nucleus moves to a higher charge number.
      The slow neutron capture process (or s-process), where the timescale to capture neutrons is slower than beta decay; and rapid neutron capture (or r-process), where successive neutron captures occur before the nucleus beta-decays.
      The net effect of the neutron capture timescale for the s- and r-processes is that the s-process takes place very close to stability, and the r-process very far from stability, and the nuclei tend to pile up at the closed neutron shells.
      The slow neutron-capture process, or s-process, likely occurs in asymptotic giant branch stars during their normal evolution.
      On the other hand, the rapid neutron-capture, or r-process, requires high neutron number densities, which cannot be attained during quiescent stellar burning, and indicates an explosive environment.

    <aside class="notes">
      This is a movie is a zoom-out showing how the r-process may proceed along the whole chart of nuclides.
      Eventually, the neutron flux decreases, and the nuclei beta decay back to stability and form this r-process abundance pattern.
      So we have a pretty good understanding of the nuclear physics in these processes.
      Now, how do we know that the r-process happens at all?

    <aside class="notes">
     Today, CCSNe are not supported by modern simulations as main r-process sources.
     Instead, the current favorite sites are NSMs, even more so after the gravitational wave event in 2017. 
     In order to study these possible sites observationally, we need a pure signature of the r-process event. R-II stars are perfect for this since they are essentially records of r-process events.
     The limitation is that metal-poor stars are already very rare in the MW, and fewer than 5% of those rare stars are r-II stars. If we want to study the r-process observationally and be able to distinguish between r-processs sites, we need more stars that display this r-process signature. So what are we doing about it?

      Through this huge undertaking, the R-Process Alliance has already observed about 1350 metal-poor stars. I have personally observed about 400 of those. We expect about 3 to 5 percent of metal-poor stars to be r-II stars, so it's necessary to observe such a large number of metal-poor stars to get to our goal of 75. The analysis is very slow, so only about 500 have been analyzed so far, about 300 of which I've done personally. Of those 500, we have already identified over 30 new r-II stars. As of a few years ago, we only knew of about 30 r-II stars that existed, so we already doubled that number.

      How we identify these r-II stars is through high-resolution spectroscopy. The r-process signatures we look for do not appear with lower-resolution spectra, so we need to take high-resolution. It takes about 30 minutes on a 2.5-meter telescope to obtain each of these spectra. We look for mainly three elements to characterize the stars we observe: Strontium, Barium, and Europium. Then we use the relative abundances of these elements to classify whether the stars are r-process enhanced. In particular, we use Europium to classify r-II stars since Europium is mainly produced by the r-process. Notice this r-II star has a very strong Europium feature, but these other two stars are not as enhanced in r-process elements. We do this for each star in our sample in order to produce plots like these [NEXT SLIDE].

    For stars that show the entire r-process pattern, there is a variation from star to star in the actinide-to-lanthanide ratio.
    For example, in Reticiulum II, the "r-process dwarf galaxy," the one star where a thorium abundance could be measured shows a low actinide-to-lanthanide abundance.
    Most r-proces enhanced stars have a relative thorium abundance that approximately agrees with the Solar value, and some are enhanced in thorium, these actinide-boost stars.
    These differences in the relative actinide abundances could be a hint that certain r-process conditions, or point to different r-proces sites entirely, are responsible for producing the actinides.

    In an astrophysical r-process event, the initial electron fraction---or Ye---is one parameter that sensitively affects the final r-process abundances that are produced.
    Just as a reminder, a lower Ye means more neutron-rich, and higher Ye is more proton-rich
    and essentially sets the initial amount of neutrons that are available to participate in neutron-capture.
    [MOVIE] For example, with all else being equal, in certain situations, starting at a somewhat low Ye may produce just the second r-process peak---elements like Barium and Tellurium.
    Decreasing the initial Ye produces the lanthanides, but not necessarily the third peak.
    Further decreasing the initial Ye can eventually produce actinides in the final abundance pattern.
    Then, as the initial material gets more and more neutron-rich, the actinides oscillate. We see this explicitly in [NEXT]

	So we built a model to do this that uses a Monte Carlo method.
	First, we ran about one hundred r-process nucleosynthesis simulations using PRISM 
	starting at different Ye's, each of which produces a distinct final abundance pattern.
	Then, we give the model constraints using three elements.
	[PLAY]
	The model randomly picks a number of initial Ye's, then adds together the final abundance patterns.
	If the summed abundance pattern agrees with the input abundances, then we keep that randomly-chosen set of Ye's and add them to this distribution on the left.
	This is the orange line in this movie. We run this hundred of thousands of times until this distribution converges.

      We can quantify the contribution from the very-low Ye component. 
      This plot is a little complicated. Basically, we ran a series of these simulations where we varied the required actinide contribution systematically, 
      and this axis shows what percentage of the total ejected mass is allowed to be in that low-Ye tail.
      The gray dots show what the low-Ye contribution would be for individual stars after running this model.
      Notice a few things. First---if you were to project this into a histogram---the actinide-boost stars are just at the tail of an otherwise normal/Gaussian distribution.
      Secondly, the low-Ye contribution that we get from the ADM results varies smoothly from actinide-poor to actinide-boost.
      So what does this imply?
